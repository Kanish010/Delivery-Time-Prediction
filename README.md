### Demand Forecasting:
This model leverages LSTM neural networks to forecast demand, aiding supply chain optimization. It fetches data from MySQL, preprocesses it, trains the LSTM model, and evaluates its performance. Predictions are made based on product features like price, promotion, and weather conditions. Performance metrics include MSE, MAE, and R2, with a scatter plot visualizing actual vs. predicted sales volume.
